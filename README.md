## Description

This is your go-to for statistics in the NBA.

NBA Wizard provides streamlined data with a simplified interface, so you can get the stats you need fast.
Most websites that provide all the latest information for the NBA are bloated with articles, ads, etc. It can be overwhelming especially for someone who has only recently started watching the NBA. Users want a website that cuts all the bloat and gives them the information they want right away.
We wanted to provide this experience to users who are getting into the NBA or have been watching the NBA for years. 

## Features
